### Hi there 👋

I'm Paolo Francioso, a SAP Business Solutions Manager & Solution Architect who still likes to have fun with programming and technologies. This is my personal repository (All the Projects stored here are not related to my company, but are for personal purposes only).

Who am I?
- 😎 I'm an ABAP Ninja
- 🐶 I'm a royal member of the Free Dogs Consulting family
- 🤖 I’m currently working on Telegram Bots
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyhton
- ⚡ Fun fact: No matter how much I study and make a career, for someone I will always remain a f@\*ing technician.
